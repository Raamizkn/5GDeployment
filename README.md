# 5GDeployment
Used AI to analyze geographic and demographic data for optimal 5G tower placement, taking into account factors like population density, terrain, and signal interference.

# AI-Enhanced 5G Deployment Analysis

This project uses AI to analyze geographic and demographic data for optimal 5G tower placement, considering factors such as population density and proximity to existing towers.

## Features
- Geospatial data analysis using GeoPandas
- AI clustering with K-Means
- Interactive map visualization with Folium

## Files
- `5g_deployment_analysis.py`: Python script for the project
- `population_data.csv`: Mock population data
- `existing_towers.csv`: Mock existing tower data
- `geo_data.geojson`: Mock geographic data
- `5g_deployment_analysis.html`: Interactive map output

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/5g-deployment-analysis.git
